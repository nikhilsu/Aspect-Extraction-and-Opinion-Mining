This corpus is based on the Customer Review Datasets (5 products) corpus described in: M. Hu, B. Liu, Mining and summarizing customer reviews, in: Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2004, pp. 168–177; see Bing Liu's Opinion Lexicon page. We used the text of that corpus, removed all original annotations and comments, and manually added annotation of implicit aspects and implicit aspect indicators.
