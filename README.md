# SparkBusters
The idea of this project is to visualise aspect-based opinion of certain products (electronics specifically) based on demographics, sentiments and heat maps. A user can see opinions and sentiments of people for a particular product of a particular electronics brand on a heat map. The user can change demographics (location, gender, age-group) etc. to have get a better analysis of what people like or don't like about a particular product.  This application can be helpful to companies who want to have get an idea of how the response of people in a particular location is when a product is launched.

# Project Application
